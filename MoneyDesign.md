### Q: Why can’t unit of account and store of value be the same?
```
- In theory… with tokenized assets, could store your wealth in diversified basket of assets, and spend fractions of it at store
- easier for digital assets than physical assets
- tokenized gold makes it possible tho
- As a store of value you probably need less velocity/ liquidity and something more correlated to a CPI index
- Hard to create an etf on chain that replicates an adjusted synthetic CPI index
- Treasury bonds tokenization via spv and security interest is also a good experiment but don’t track cpi index
```

### Q: Money in current design
Today’s economies operate under modern monetary theory mechanisms and therefore, unlike gold eras, it’s hard for any money to simultaneously be store of value, unit of account and medium of exchange. It’s kind of like a trike a trilemma. A money can only serve two but not three roles.
